# Equity market analysis 

Stage:
1. Get data in python
2. Data Parocessing and vizualization
3. From a vector of stocks $n$, find at each time $t$ at which you upload the data, what the weights of the stocks are.
4. Determine moves to do at each time interval. Possibly add some execution constraints e.g. quantity of stocks bought and sold each day, transation cost.

Implement it with Python on a Jupyter Notebook.
